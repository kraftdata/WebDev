    <h3><p>
        Yahoo is a pioneering American web services provider founded in 1994, offering a range of online products like Yahoo Mail, news, finance, and sports.
        Despite past prominence, it faced declines in influence and reputation, notably due to data breaches. In 2017, Verizon acquired its internet assets, 
        integrating them into Verizon Media. Today, Yahoo continues providing services under this umbrella, though its user base has diminished amidst fierce 
        competition from companies like Google and Facebook.

        Google, a tech giant founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, has evolved into much more than just a search engine. Renowned for its
        innovative products and services, Google dominates various sectors including search, advertising, cloud computing, and mobile operating systems 
        with Android. Its suite of applications like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Maps are ubiquitous in daily life. Beyond technology, 
        Google invests heavily in AI research, self-driving cars, and renewable energy. With its motto "Don't be evil" (now "Do the right thing"), 
        Google continues to shape the digital landscape, aiming to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
